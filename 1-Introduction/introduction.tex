\section{Objectives and Motivation}

During the INTERLACE project requirements for a interest-free mutual credit system have been collected and written down in deliverable D2.1 and D3.1[TODO Ref]. The requirements have been precisely formulated using "Abstracts State Interacting Machines" - short ASIMs. These ASIM specifications were used to create a working ICEF implementation [TODO Ref], which also has been described in D3.1.

During the last step, which is described in this report (deliverable D3.2) the focusing is put on the creation of a working prototype. That prototype provides basic payment capabilities facilitating a highly distributed and scalable implementation of a distributed ledger technology (DLT).

\section{Scope and Organization}

That report gives insights to the prototype created. It discusses the technologies used and provides feedback on how they have been applied in order to achieve a working implementation capable of accepting basic transfers.

Further, information is given on how the system can be installed and used for paying. The system can be therefore used to prove and test various use cases in order to understand the chosen DLT approach.

For productive systems which might build upon the INTERLACE prototype important features are discussed, which are needed to be handled during the realisation of such a payment system. Thus the transition from a client-server to a peer to peer based model together with possible challenges are described and exemplary approaches explained.

Finally, an outlook is given which elaborates about possible scenarios that may be applied for a productive scenario.
