\section{ASIM and block-chain}
\label{sec:asim}

Creating a scalable distributed application is a big challenge. Even more when monolithic legacy systems need to be addressed, like in case of the Sardex payment systems realized on Sardinia. For INTERLACE this meant to deal with a system which is currently stable and working reliable, however, which is not scaling well in order to provided multiple other circuits beside from the original one in Sardina.

This report will describe a prototypical solution on how distribution and saleability are handled using proper technologies which allow the idea of a mutual credit system to grow and evolve. In detail for INTERLACE a architectural process was introduced. This process is trying to thoroughly use models which are well tested and shared amongst each other in a very specific and detailed way.

As described in \cite{INTERLACE_D21} and ASM definition has been declared which acts as a ground model for the INTERLACE prototype. Then this paper based definition has been transformed in executable code realized with the ICEF\footnote{Interaction Computing Execution Framework}. As next step, which attains attention in this report, is the last before the actual testing which needs to be done on various levels.
