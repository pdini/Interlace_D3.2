This last chapter discuss the goals reached as well as the problems encountered during developing the INTERLACE prototype. Additionally, emphasis on possible enhancements necessary and issues which needs to be taken into account in order to bring that prototype to productive solution.

\section{Falsey and Pitfalls}

When using hyperledger composer but also when connecting to hyperledger fabric directly some points are important to take care of. Developers have to be aware that working with chain-code or smart contracts, although highly abstracted from the user already by various frameworks, to interact with a distributed ledger like a blockchain, is quite different from accessing data as usual in a RDBMS\footnote{Relational Database Management System}.

Next some of those typical peculiarities are approached attempted to be cleared up.

TODO ------------------------

\begin{verbatim}
  - id/date-issues, "finality"
  - concurrency issues - ledger needs to be evaluate-able any time
  - create objects/entries deterministically
  - connection rest server
  - from messages to transaction events
  - different network versions!! model inconsistencies, changes/errors "permanent"
  - enum mapping (move from chain-code section?)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Identity Management}
\label{sec:id-management}

TODO ------------------------

\begin{verbatim}
  - permissions
  - https://www.codementor.io/gangachris125/passport-jwt-authentication-for-hyperledger-composer-rest-server-jqfgkoljn
  - passport.js (swagger) www.passportjs.org/docs/
  - user profile strategies
